    <p>A growing archive connecting botanical folk with shops and gardens.<br></br>
    From a local's perspective.<br></br>
    <br>
    </br>



    Petal Scout is an initiative to spread the garden growth and love to those who want to explore! Many greenhouses lack an online presence- instead of working with each gardener or shop owner creating that, we  figured why not make a space that gives them all a home.<br></br>
    Users can search by city, and then see what botanical hot spots are in that area. Each specific spot will have a small insight page exploring the greenhouse a bit further from a writeup and photos from whoever wishes to be the petal scout of that location. <br></br></p>
